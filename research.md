1. Independently predict 3D partial human poses as SMPL meshes  in pytorch3d following Rockwellâ€™s methods. And use PointRend to obtain 2D human masks.

2. Independently predict  2D plane masks as well as 3D articulation information. 

3. Use a differential render in pytorch3d similar to the NMR in PHOSA for back-propagation,  to build a similar system optimizing the position and size of the person considering 3d space relationship and interaction for each single image.

## Convex Presentations of Translation Surfaces

*Student Group: Andrew Keisling, Brendan Nell, Kaiwen Lu, Siyi Chen*

*Advisors: [Chaya Norton](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/postdoc-faculty/nchaya.html), [Paul Apisa](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~apisa/)*

*Mentors: Christopher Zhang, Sayantan Khan*

1. We (a group of students really green to topology) have designed and implemented beta versions of enumerating origamis in H(2).
2. We have utilized SageMath to implement the convexity test presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3606) by Lelievre and Weiss.
