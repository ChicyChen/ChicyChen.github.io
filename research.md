1. Independently predict 3D partial human poses as SMPL meshes  in pytorch3d following Rockwellâ€™s methods. And use PointRend to obtain 2D human masks.

2. Independently predict  2D plane masks as well as 3D articulation information. 

3. Use a differential render in pytorch3d similar to the NMR in PHOSA for back-propagation,  to build a similar system optimizing the position and size of the person considering 3d space relationship and interaction for each single image.

1. We (a group of students really green to topology) have designed and implemented beta versions of enumerating origamis in H(2).
2. We have utilized SageMath to implement the convexity test presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3606) by Lelievre and Weiss.
