### Summary

### Remarks

Worst case run time can never < O(nlogn) for *"comparison-based"* sorting algoritms.



### Questions

1. Definition of stability?

2. How to adapt to linked list (**singly linked list**, doubly linked list)?

3. What are the running time complexity then?

4. Are all array-based sorts internal sorts?
