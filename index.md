Hi! My name is Siyi Chen (陈思怡), Chicy is my nick name, and Stella is my real English name.

I am an incoming ECE PhD student in [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), advised by Professor [Zhongming Liu](https://libi.engin.umich.edu/profile/zhongming-liu/) and Professor [Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/).

Previously I was a dual degree undergraduate student: At [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), I major in CSE & minor in Mathematics. At [UMJI](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), I major in ECE. At UM, I am lucky to be advised by professor [David Fouhey](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fouhey/) on topics related to 3D computer vision.
