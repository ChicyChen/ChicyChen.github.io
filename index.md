Hi, I am Siyi Chen (陈思怡). You can also call me Stella.

Currently, I am an ECE PhD student in [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), luckily advised by Professor [Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/). My research interests are representation learning, multimodality, and diffusion models.

Previously I was a dual degree undergraduate student: At [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), I major in CSE & minor in Mathematics. At [UMJI](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), I major in ECE. At UM, I was luckily advised by professor [David Fouhey](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fouhey/) and mentored by [Shengyi Qian](https://jasonqsy.github.io/) on computer vision.
