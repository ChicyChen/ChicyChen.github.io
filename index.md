## About Me

Hi, I am Siyi Chen (陈思怡). You can also call me Stella.

Currently, I am an ECE PhD student in [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) (2022 - Present), luckily advised by Professor [Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/). My research interests encompass *generative models*, *representation learning*, and *their connections*. I am keen on understanding the learning mechanisms and the acquired information structure of generative and perceptual models. I aim to utilize the theoretical understandings for unified and interpretable applications while combining inspirations from optimization techniques, principles of physics, and human cognition. Specifically, I am exploring these questions in diffusion models, multimodal learning, self-supervised learning, and dynamics modeling.

Previously, I was a dual degree undergraduate student (2018 - 2022): At [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), I majored in CSE & minored in Mathematics. At [UMJI](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), I majored in ECE. At UM, I was luckily advised by professor [David Fouhey](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fouhey/) and mentored by [Shengyi Qian](https://jasonqsy.github.io/) on computer vision.
