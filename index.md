## About Me

Hi, I am Siyi Chen (陈思怡). You can also call me Stella.

Currently, I am an ECE PhD student in [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) (2022 - Present), luckily advised by Professor [Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/). My research interests are generative models, representation learning, and their connections. I am interested in understanding the learning mechanism and learned information of generative or perception models for unified and interpretable utilization, and desiging better learning algorithms with inspirations from optimization, physics, and human brains. Specifically, I am studying the aforementioned questions in diffusion models, multimodal learning, self-supervised representation learning, and dynamics modeling.

Previously, I was a dual degree undergraduate student (2018 - 2022): At [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), I majored in CSE & minored in Mathematics. At [UMJI](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), I majored in ECE. At UM, I was luckily advised by professor [David Fouhey](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fouhey/) and mentored by [Shengyi Qian](https://jasonqsy.github.io/) on computer vision.
